# BAFU Copied-Processes Toolkit — Issue #36

A working prototype prepared for the Brightcon 2026 hackathon, issue #36
("Modelisation of BAFU copied processes"). Nothing in this folder depends on
any cloud/Claude path — it runs on your own machine with the steps below.

## What it does (30-second version)

Most of the BAFU LCI processes in `sentier-inventory` are the same
`reference_product` copied once per country/period (e.g. "Electricity, low
voltage, at grid" is stored as 81 separate per-country copies). This tool
splits every exchange row into two parts:

- **structure** — which flow items exist, what unit they're in (stored once
  per family)
- **values** — how much of each item exists for a given country/period
  (numeric, small)

and proves this reconstructs the original data **losslessly** (round-trip),
both against our own code and against the real
`sentier-brightway` -> `bw2calc` chain.

## Who built this

Özge Özkılınç (oox@ubu, University of Burgos) — PI.

## AI tool used, and how the output was checked

Built with **Claude** (Anthropic), used throughout for design, coding, and
iteration on this toolkit. Every claim the toolkit makes is backed by a
runnable check rather than taken on trust from the model:

- **Round-trip correctness** — `full_run.py` rebuilds all 766 copied-process
  families from the compact structure/values model and diffs every row
  against the original `exchanges.parquet`: 766/766 match exactly, 0
  failures (see "Step 3" below).
- **Real LCA-engine cross-check** — `validate/compare_multi.py` rebuilds a
  `sentier-brightway` data cache with our model and compares real `bw2calc`
  method scores against the untouched original: they match exactly (Step 4).
- **Independent third-party data** — the same model was applied to a
  completely separate `.bw2package` export (see "Based on" below) with no
  code changes, and the round-trip held there too — evidence this isn't a
  fit to our own data's quirks.
- **Forecasting stretch goal reported honestly** — `forecast_superstructure.py`'s
  leave-one-out results are reported with both a naive baseline and
  precision/recall/F1 (not just MAE, which can be misleading on sparse
  data), including where the method is still weak (e.g. extreme outlier
  countries) — see REPORT.md.

## Based on

- **Method** — the MILP forecasting step (`forecast_superstructure.py`)
  adapts the superstructure / big-M disjunctive-programming pattern from
  Edgar, Himmelblau & Lasdon, *Optimization of Chemical Processes*, 2nd ed.
  (Sec. 9.6, Example 14.6) to a data-reconstruction problem instead of a
  chemical flowsheet. This is a copyrighted textbook: only the modeling
  *technique* is referenced here (as code + a written explanation in
  REPORT.md), no text or figures from the book are reproduced or
  redistributed.
- **Independent validation data** — [`electricity_grids_inventory.bw2package`](https://lci-electricity-93d31c.gitlab.io/electricity_grids_inventory.bw2package),
  from Eaternity's [lci-electricity](https://lci-electricity-93d31c.gitlab.io/index.html)
  project (a separate, non-Sentier project also built on BAFU/UVEK 2026
  data). Used only locally to validate the round-trip model against
  independent data — **not redistributed or committed here**, see the
  project's own page for the file. Licence: data CC-BY-4.0, code
  Apache-2.0 (per the project's own page); BAFU-derived output there
  carries attribution to "Life Cycle Inventory database of the Swiss
  Federal Administration, BAFU 2026."
- **Primary data** — `sentier-inventory` (MIT licence, see its own repo),
  sourced from the Life Cycle Inventory database of the Swiss Federal
  Administration (BAFU:2026). Not committed here either — see "Setup"
  below, you clone it yourself. `sentier-inventory`'s own README states its
  content is MIT; the underlying BAFU database's own redistribution terms
  aren't independently restated beyond that, so if you plan to redistribute
  derived data further, it's worth confirming with BAFU/sentier-dev
  directly rather than assuming.

## Setup

```bash
# 1) Clone sentier-inventory INSIDE this folder (same level as bafu-copied-processes/'s own contents)
cd bafu-copied-processes
git clone https://github.com/sentier-dev/sentier-inventory

# 2) Python dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The folder layout should now look like this:

```
bafu-copied-processes/
  sentier-inventory/     <- the data repo you just cloned
  src/
  schema/
  validate/
  requirements.txt
```

If you cloned the data somewhere else, every script accepts either a
`--data-root /your/path` flag or an environment variable:

```bash
export BAFU_DATA_ROOT=/your/path/sentier-inventory
```

## Quick start — one compact command

`src/bafu.py` is a single front door for everything below (Steps 1–3d), so
you don't have to remember or run six separate scripts:

```bash
cd src
python bafu.py              # runs every step in order, with defaults (~2 min total)
python bafu.py classify     # ...or just one step, e.g. Step 1
python bafu.py forecast --reference-product "Electricity, production mix"
python bafu.py <step> -h    # see that step's own options
```

Available steps: `classify` (1), `validate` (2), `fullrun` (3), `timecheck`
(3b), `schema` (3c), `forecast` (3d) — same names as the section headers
below. Each one still works as its own standalone script too
(`python classify.py`, `python forecast_superstructure.py --reference-product ...`,
etc.); `bafu.py` just wraps them, it doesn't replace them. The sections below
describe each step in more detail, including Step 4 (real `bw2calc`
validation), which is a separate, heavier process and stays outside `bafu.py`
on purpose (its own venv, see Step 4).

Every run of `bafu.py` also saves a plain-text copy of everything it printed
to `reports/bafu_report_<step-or-all>_<timestamp>.txt` (next to `src/`), so
you have a ready-made report to paste into a write-up or attach as evidence,
without copy-pasting from the terminal. Pass `--no-report` to skip that.

## Step 1 — Classify all "copied-process" families

```bash
cd src
python classify.py
```

Output: a bucket breakdown on the console (`trivial-template` /
`template-with-variation` / `variable-mix`) plus
`bafu-copied-processes/data/families.parquet` (pass `--csv` if you also
want a human-readable `families.csv` copy for local inspection -- off by
default since it's a duplicate of the same table and this generated
`data/` folder isn't committed to the repo; see `.gitignore`).

## Step 2 — Validate the model on one family

```bash
python model.py
```

Runs the round-trip test on 4 example families (easy/medium/hard cases) and
prints the compression statistics.

## Step 3 — Validate the model on ALL families

```bash
python full_run.py
```

Rebuilds every classified family and checks that row counts match, then
prints the total structure/value row ratio.

## Step 3b — The time axis (the "adapted for time" part of the issue)

```bash
python model_time.py
```

Adds the 32 time-tagged processes in the electricity sector (winter/summer
2018) as a second axis (`time_tag`) and validates the round-trip.

## Step 3d — Forecast a held-out member via superstructure optimization (stretch goal)

```bash
python forecast_superstructure.py --reference-product "Electricity, production mix"
```

Treats `structure.parquet`'s technology catalog for a family as a
**superstructure** (in the sense of Edgar, Himmelblau & Lasdon,
*Optimization of Chemical Processes*, 2nd ed., Sec. 9.6 "Disjunctive
Programming" and Example 14.6 "Reaction Synthesis via MINLP"): a binary
variable per candidate technology (used or not) and a continuous variable
for its share, linked by the same big-M constraint the book uses for
flowsheet synthesis (`x <= U*y`), plus bounds learned from the other family
members and -- **only for families whose technosphere inputs all share one
unit** (e.g. electricity mixes, where every input is a share of 1 kWh) -- a
mass-balance constraint (shares sum to 1). A family like "Natural gas, at
production onshore" mixes kg/MJ/Nm3/tkm inputs that legitimately sum to
~2-6, not ~1, so the constraint is skipped there
(`_homogeneous_unit_inputs` in `forecast_superstructure.py`) rather than
imposed anyway; its leave-one-out numbers are therefore not reported as a
validated benchmark result (see REPORT.md).

For every real location in the family, it hides that location's data,
solves the MILP using only the *other* locations, and compares the result
against the real (held-out) values -- a leave-one-out validation of
"can we synthesize a member we don't have data for." Needs `pulp` (in
`requirements.txt`; bundles the open-source CBC solver, nothing else to
install). Use `--target-location XX` to see one country's full
slot-by-slot comparison instead of the summary table.

By default the objective anchors on same-region neighbors first (`geo.py`
resolves a location to Europe/Asia/Africa/North America/Latin
America/Oceania, falling back to the global mean per slot when there are
fewer than 3 same-region training points) rather than the whole family's
mean -- this measurably helps regional outliers like France's
nuclear-heavy mix. Pass `--anchor global` to use the plain whole-family
mean instead (the original version, useful for comparison).

## Step 3c — Generate real schema files

```bash
python build_demo_schema_files.py
```

Produces real `structure.parquet` / `values.parquet` files matching
`schema/structure.yaml` and `schema/values.yaml` (default: the
02-electricity sector; override with `--sector`). Output:
`bafu-copied-processes/demo-schema-output/data/<sector>/`.

## Step 4 (optional, heavier) — Validate against the real sentier-brightway -> bw2calc chain

This step proves the model doesn't just pass our own round-trip test, but
also doesn't change a single number in the real Brightway calculation
chain. We recommend a separate venv, since `sentier-brightway` installs its
own pinned `bw2calc`/`bw2data` versions:

```bash
cd ..                                   # back to the bafu-copied-processes/ root
python3 -m venv sb-venv
source sb-venv/bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/sentier-dev/sentier-brightway

# Download and export the original data (untouched reference)
sentier-brightway files --out ./bafu-files-original

# Find sentier-brightway's own cache (the pinned data it downloaded) and
# make a WORKING copy of it (the path is printed by the coverage command,
# usually under ~/.cache/sentier-brightway/<hash>/):
cp -r ~/.cache/sentier-brightway/<hash> ./data-root

# Rebuild the sentier-inventory copy inside that working copy with our model:
python ../validate/rebuild_inventory.py --data-root ./data-root/sentier-inventory

# Export the rebuilt data:
sentier-brightway files --out ./bafu-files-ours --data-root ./data-root

# Compare the two (bw2calc scores should match exactly):
python ../validate/compare_multi.py --original ./bafu-files-original --ours ./bafu-files-ours

# To see all method scores for a single process:
python ../validate/demo_score.py --files-dir ./bafu-files-original --process "Electricity, low voltage, at grid" --location CH
```

If `compare_multi.py` prints `OK` on every row, the model doesn't change the
real LCA result at all.

## Notes

- `classify.py`, `model.py`, `model_time.py`, and `build_demo_schema_files.py`
  don't depend on any absolute path: they read the data root from either the
  `BAFU_DATA_ROOT` environment variable, a `--data-root` argument, or (if
  neither is given) the `sentier-inventory/` folder at this toolkit's own
  root.
- The scripts in `validate/` require `bw2calc`/`bw_processing` — these come
  automatically with the `sentier-brightway` install, so we recommend running
  them in a separate venv (Step 4).
